# TaSTy
COP23 TaST Analytics

The purpose of this project is to process the TaST and historic results/targets from the MER Structured Dataset to leverage during the COP23 Target setting process.

## Setting up

To get started, you will want to make sure all of the required R packages are installed on your machine. If you do not have these packages installed, run the following code:

``` r

#install OHA packages
  remotes::install_github("USAID-OHA-SI/gagglr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
  remotes::install_github("USAID-OHA-SI/glamr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
  remotes::install_github("USAID-OHA-SI/gophr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
  




```
